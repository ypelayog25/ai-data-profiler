AI Data Profiler

This project showcases how to use Python and Artificial Intelligence to analyze unknown datasets and generate automatic reports with actionable insights.

In real-world scenarios, data analysts often receive files with no clear documentation or defined structure. The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how to tackle that challenge with an automated workflow that:

Detects columns and data types without manual setup.

Instantly computes metrics and distributions.

Identifies outliers, correlations, and missing values.

Uses AI to provide human-readable explanations of the findings.

üîç Business value: this approach saves time, accelerates decision-making, and helps non-technical teams better understand the data.
